# Privacy Policy - GWT Helper

The GWT Helper extension for Visual Studio Code collects anonymous usage data to help improve the extension's features and stability.

## Data Collected

We collect **only** the following data:

- **Installation**: When the extension is installed
- **Activation**: When the extension is activated
- **Feature Usage**: Basic information about which features are used (without any content details)
  - Compiling a project
  - Running DevMode
  - Running CodeServer
  - Running Jetty
  - Other feature interactions

## Data NOT Collected

The extension **does not collect**:

- Project source code or content
- Java code or GWT-specific implementation details
- Personal information or identifiers
- File names or project structure
- System information beyond what VS Code provides
- IP addresses or location data

## Why We Collect This Data

This minimal telemetry helps us:

- Understand how many users are actively using the extension
- Identify which features are most valuable
- Prioritize improvements and bug fixes
- Enhance overall extension stability and performance

## How to Disable Data Collection

You can disable telemetry collection in two ways:

1. **GWT Helper specific setting**:
   - Open VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
   - Search for "gwtHelper.telemetry.enabled"
   - Uncheck the checkbox to disable

2. **Global VS Code telemetry setting**:
   - Open VS Code settings
   - Search for "telemetry.enableTelemetry"
   - Uncheck to disable all VS Code telemetry

When telemetry is disabled through either method, no data will be collected.

## Data Storage and Privacy

Telemetry data is handled in accordance with Microsoft's privacy policies for Visual Studio Code extensions. Data is anonymized and stored securely.

## Transparency

The extension displays a notification on first use informing users about telemetry collection and how to disable it.
